    <div>
      The following images employ the use of the Poisson image blending. The
      technique arises from the insight that gradients matching takes priority
      over intensity matching. In other words, the shape of the image matters
      more than the colors. In Poisson Image Blending, the gradients are formed
      into a least-squares problem using a sparse matrix. The resulting image is
      then re-shaped into the final output dimensions. Each color channel is
      blended individually and the blended channels are recomposited at the end

          FAILURE CASE: This case fails to preserve the white upper part of the
          cow. The source image had a white sky and a green ground. Because of
          how the boundary pixels are handled by the blending algorithm, this
          results in a green gradient across the cow.

          <img src="assets/sharkfin-blended.png" />
        </div>
        Here we have a shark fin in the water. This result blends well, due to
        the similarity of the background colors of the source and target images.

        <br />
        <img src="assets/ship-closeup.png" />
        The same target image does not work as well for this ship, due to the
        differences in the background of the source image.
